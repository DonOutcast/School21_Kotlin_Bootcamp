### Hello!  

Today we are going to develop a project using the object-oriented paradigm features of the language.  
Kotlin implements the classic single-parent inheritance model and the ability to implement multiple behavior interfaces, but with an interesting caveat: by default, all classes are closed to inheritance.    
A very important, one of the "killer" features of Kotlin, is Null-safety feature. This system divides all types into two parts - nullable and not null, and adds some operators to interact with nullable or not null variables. This feature allows to write null-safe code and almost to avoid NullPointer exceptions.  
Also, language developers offer several handy tools from this area, for example:
- Data/sealed classes
- The concept of a property (field + default getter/setter)
- Objects
- Extensions

Extensions deserve special attention, allowing you to extend a class or interface with new functionality without the need to inherit or use patterns such as the Decorator.

# Themes:
- OOP, classes, interfaces, files, getter/setter
- Nullable variables
- Extensions
- Exceptions

**Advice!** Continue reading the official documentation and articles about these Kotlin features. If you need, find more information about OOP principles, OOP in Kotlin and check examples before starting an exercise.

### Project: Emergency service
The city is divided into several zones, each one has its own rescue service unit. Today we are developing features for a mobile application for emergency assistance. It will handle 2 main requests: receive full information about a specific area and understand whether there are any incidents

**Advice!** If you've read anything about OOP in Kotlin, you're already acquainted with `data class` feature and its advantages. It's a very popular construction to describe peaces of data model, you should use it for "model" classes (with data) in our projects.  

# Exercises

**Requirement!** Please, make each exercise in a separate project. For example, `Day01/src/exercise1`, `Day01/src/exercise2`, `Day01/src/bonusexercise3`, etc. If the previous exercise is needed for the next one, just copy a project from the previous to the next folder and continue development within the next one.

### Exercise 1: Emergency department
Determine if an incident happened in a specific area
#### Incident description:
- An incident is determined by two integer coordinates on the coordinate plane
- An incident has:
  - Description
  - Applicant's phone number - can be null
  - A field corresponding to one of the 3 types of incidents (e.g. fire, gas leak, cat on the tree) - can be null

**Requirement!** As we said earlier, use a data class to describe model data in this and further exercises.
**Advice!** Use Enum classes to make enumerations, for example - types of incidents

#### Zone description:  
- A zone has a tetragon, triangular or round shape, representing figures on the coordinate plane
- A zone is inherited from a common rescue service, which has a common number (with operator code 800)
- Each zone has its own:
  - Phone number
  - Name
  - A code of an emergency department 
  - A level that represents a probability of an incident (low, medium, high)
- A Zone has a method to determine if an incident is within it

**Input:**
- All coordinates are entered in the form of two integer numbers separated by a semicolon. Example: 5;4
- Enter zone params: the program automatically determines the shape of the zone according to the entered data:
  - For a circle, the two things are entered divided by space: a center coordinate and radius. Example: 5;4 6
  - For a triangle three coordinates are entered divided by spaces. Example: 5;4 3;6 2;5
  - For a tetragon four coordinates are entered divided by spaces. Example: 5;4 3;6 2;5 5;9
- Another zone info, for the ease of use, should be hardcoded
- Enter the coordinates of the point of the incident
- Wrong input causes an error

**Output:**
- The program prints the full information about the zone and the incident
- The program prints if the incident is within the zone. If not, it advises to switch the applicant to the common number

_Example:_
```
Enter zone parameters:
3;4 2

The zone info:
  The shape of area: circle 
  Phone number: 89347362826
  Name: Sovetsky district
  Emergency dept: 49324
  Danger level: low 

Enter an incident coordinates:
9;9

The incident info:
  Description: the woman said her cat can't get off the tree
  Phone number: +74832648573
  Type: cat on the tree

An incident is not in Sovetsky district
Switch the applicant to the common number: 88008473824
```


### Exercise 2: The Phone mask
A phone mask is a useful UX feature that improves readability of phone numbers.  
Write an extension to the String class that applies two different masks to a phone number:
- It works with 11-digits numbers starting with 7 or 8, or with 12-digits numbers starting with +7:
  - If the operator code is 800, the number is converted to the form "8 (800) xxx xx xx"
  - For another operator, the mask is "+7 xxx xxx-xx-xx"
  - Note, that besides brackets, spaces and hyphens are added, the first (country) digit also changes according to the mask. Example: 84352835724 converts to +7 435 283-57-24 
- Other numbers are bypassed  

**Check the result:** apply this extension in the previous exercise to display information about zone's and applicant's phones, then repeat the exercise check.

_Example:_
```
...

The zone info:
... 
  Phone number: +7 934 736-28-26
...
The incident info:
...
  Phone number: +7 483 264-85-73

An incident is not in Sovetsky district
Switch the applicant to the common number: 8 (800) 847 38 24
```

### Exercise 3: Processing server responses
Assume, that we have a server for our app, and it returns a response to our requests. The response contains a response code and a message. There are a lot of different response codes - check the HTTP codes description.  
In our app, according to the code, the answer can be classified into two types: Success and Error. It's a common case, where a sealed class can be used. Implement this logic with help of sealed class:
- Success, if codes are 200 or 201. It has a message - string "The request processed successfully"
- Error, codes from 400 and more, the message is JSON with the title and description of the error

Also, errors from the server are different. Our app has classes for several errors. It's also a good case to be implemented with sealed class. Implement errors hierarchy:
- There are 4 types of known internal errors (1000-1003). They have a code, a header and a description (for desc - think of it):
  - 1000, "The user is not identified", desc
  - 1001, "The session is expired", desc 
  - 1002, "No connection", desc
  - 1003, "The device has failed the verification", desc
- The rest of the response codes (other than 200, 201, 1000-1003) are handled with a common "Unknown" error, which has the title "Error code: $code" and the description "Unknown error. Please, try again later"

Finally, let's combine our responses and errors. The application needs a handler to recognize responses and types of errors. As you guessed, you should use Error sealed class as our Error response type.  
The program must fail on non-integer input.

**Input:** the server response code is entered into the console  
**Output:** the program prints a type of the response (if an error, a concrete type of this error) and its information: code and message for Success or code, title and description for Error

_Example:_
```
Type a response code:
1003

NoConnectionError: 
  Code: 1003
  Title: No connection
  Descriprion: There is no internet connection. Try later.
```

### Bonus exercise 4: Incidents in a city
Implement the concept of a city. A city has:
  - Name
  - Collection with different zones (for simplicity, it can be hardcoded)

Determine in which zone the incident is happened. If the incident point falls between zones, the program switches it to the department from the nearest zone  

**Input:** enter the point of an incident  
**Output:** In the beginning, the program prints city info: name + the common emergency number (masked). Then, it prints the full information about the incident and the zone handles it (with phones masked)

_Example:_
```
Enter an incident coordinates:
9;9

The city info:
  Name: Novosibirsk 
  The common number: 8 (800) 847 38 24

The incident info:
  Description: the woman said her cat can't get off the tree
  Phone number: +7 934 736-28-26
  Type: cat on the tree

The incident didn't match with any zone. The nearest zone: Sovetsky district
The zone info:
  The shape of area: circle 
  Phone number: +7 934 736-28-26
  Name: Sovetsky district
  Emergency dept: 49324
  Danger level: low 
```
